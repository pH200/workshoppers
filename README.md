# Workshoppers

The portable collection of workshoppers from [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/)

## Installation

Clone this repository.

## Usage

#### 1. Activate Workshoppers

```sh
source workshops.sh
```

#### 2. Install the workshopper

```sh
## Install to the local node_modules
npm install functional-javascript-workshop
## Or, you can use "npm install" to install all workshops. It's slow, however.
```

#### 3. Use the workshopper

```sh
functional-javascript-workshop
```

All workshoppers are sourced from step 1. You can now use these
workshoppers without installing them globally.
